    "In this first practical application assignment of the program, you will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not. Use the [Coupon Jupyter Notebook](./Coupon.ipynb) to complete this assignment."
