# Will the customer accept the coupon?

## Overview

In this first practical application assignment of the program, you will seek to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

## Jupyter Notebook

Analysis performed with [Coupon Jupyter Notebook](./Coupon.ipynb).

+ Optional: Use the virtual environment of your choice
+ Install python modules using the ```requirements.txt``` file.

```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Summary of Findings

**the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.**

+ To explore the data, you will utilize your knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python.

+ You will publish your findings in a public facing GitHub repository as your first portfolio piece.

This is a required assignment and counts toward program completion.
